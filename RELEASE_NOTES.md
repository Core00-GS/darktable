library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.2.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## Bug Fixes

- Graduated Density : Fix density computation for negative EVs.

### API Version

- N/A

### Other Lua changes

- N/A

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be achieved by removing line 241 of the
  `darktable.css` file on your system. See
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166.

- Starting with this release a new support policy regarding macOS
  versions will be in place -- darktable releases will now only
  support those macOS versions that are also supported by Apple.
  Release 4.4 therefore drops support for macOS versions older than
  11.3.
