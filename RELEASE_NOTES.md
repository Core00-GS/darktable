We're proud to announce the new bug fix release of darktable, 4.2.1!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-4.2.1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-4.2.1).

As always, please don't use the autogenerated tarball provided by
github, but only our tar.xz file. The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1.tar.xz
??? darktable-4.2.1.tar.xz
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1.dmg
??? darktable-4.2.1.dmg
$ sha256sum darktable-4.2.1.exe
??? darktable-4.2.1.exe
```

When updating from the stable 4.0.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.0.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.
